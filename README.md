# SimpleGitPusher
### This is part of "My utilities" series

This little shell script is a simple utility that helps you push to your remote repository in one command.  
This utility is aimed at mostly beginners, or People who commit tiny changes often,  
and find that typing out three commands in order to make that one little push is exhausting.

*I use this little script to make all of the push to this project*

Note: This utility is written for the **unix bash shell**.

#### You can use this utility by
1. Make sure you have the utility and you know the path to the **push** file.
2. If, for example, you have the **push** file in your current working folder, you can run:  
`./push "My commit message"` where *My commit message* is your commit message.   
This will add all the updated files, commit using the commit message provided,  
and push to your pre-defined origin.

*A better version is being planned, to be written in C, and when it is ready, the link to it will appear here.*
